# mapeo-exporter
> Export data from Mapeo 5 to import into Mapeo 6

## Private project data
The goal is to not need private project data to be able to develop this project or other Mapeo projects. If you need access to the private data bring it up in the `#tech` channel in the Dd slack.

## Generating test data
Example of generating test data: https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-webmaps-public/blob/master/scripts/create-random-map.js
